# 🛠️ From Chatbots to a Full-Service Agency: Branca's Journey of Pivoting  

When Branca first launched, we were an **AI automation agency**, building chatbots for solar businesses using Botpress. It was an exciting time, and we saw a huge opportunity in helping businesses streamline their operations through AI-driven automation.  

But as we scaled, two things became clear:  
1. **The barrier to entry was too low.**  
2. **The vertical became saturated almost overnight.**  

Every other agency was offering chatbots, and it quickly turned into a race to the bottom.  

## 🌟 The Power of Pivoting  

Instead of sticking to a market that no longer aligned with our goals, we made the bold decision to **pivot**. Today, Branca is:  
- A **marketing agency** helping higher-end SMBs with web design, SEO, and social media marketing.  
- Actively developing tools like **Business Intelligence dashboards, Cybersecurity/Fraud Prevention solutions, and a CRM** to bring more value to our clients.  

We’ve shifted from offering a single solution to becoming a **partner in growth** for ambitious SMBs.  

## 🚀 Lessons Learned  

Pivoting isn’t easy. It requires humility to admit something isn’t working, vision to identify new opportunities, and determination to execute the change. But pivots aren’t failures—they’re **evolutions** that lead to growth.
