# 🌟 Building a UTM Link Generator and Analytics Dashboard with React

In this post, I’ll walk you through how I built a simplified UTM Link Generator and Analytics Dashboard, inspired by tools like Bitly. This project serves as a hands-on learning experience to understand React fundamentals, state management, and building an MVP.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **UTM Link Generator and Analytics Dashboard** is a React app that simplifies the process of creating UTM-enhanced short URLs and tracking basic metrics. It's designed as a lightweight version of Bitly but includes basic analytics.

### ✨ Key Features
- **UTM Link Generation**: A form to create UTM-enhanced short URLs.
- **Click Tracking**: Each short URL tracks the number of times it's clicked.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Displays original URLs, short links, and click counts.
- **Persistence**: Uses localStorage to save data between sessions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (with state management via `useState` and `useEffect`).
- **Persistence**: localStorage for storing generated links and click data.
- **Styling**: Tailored design with custom CSS in `App.css`.

## 🏗️ Building the Project

### **Step 1: Creating the UTM Generator**
The first step was building a form to accept a base URL and generate short links. I also added input validation to ensure URLs start with `http://` or `https://`.

### **Step 2: Adding Analytics**
Next, I added a dashboard to display short links, their original counterparts, and click counts. Clicking a short URL increments the click count and updates the dashboard in real time.

### **Step 3: Styling the App**
Finally, I added a simple, clean design inspired by Exodus Wallet. The app is styled with custom CSS for a polished look.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

1. **React State Management**: Using `useState` and `useEffect` to manage and persist state.
2. **localStorage**: A quick way to add persistence to a frontend-only app.
3. **Building MVPs**: Simplifying complex tools into smaller, functional components for learning and prototyping.

## 🔮 What’s Next?

This project is a great foundation, but there are several directions to expand:
- **Backend Integration**: Add Django for centralized data storage.
- **Advanced UTM Support**: Include more detailed UTM parameter options.
- **Data Visualization**: Use libraries like Chart.js to display analytics visually.
