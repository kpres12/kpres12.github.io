# 🚀 Building Branca: What I’ve Been Up To

Hey there, GitHub friends! 👋

It’s been a great couple weeks and Holidays, and I wanted to take a moment to share what I’ve been up to lately—because it’s been a journey. **Spoiler:** I started a company.

---

## 🎯 Why Branca?

The idea for Branca came out of frustration. My co-founder and I spent years watching clients struggle with tools that didn’t fit their needs.  

Whether it was **bloated software** built for enterprises or **hacky patchwork solutions**, the gap was clear:  
➡️ **Businesses deserve tools actually built for them.**

So, we decided to stop complaining and start building. Enter **Branca**: our take on **tailored, powerful, and affordable business intelligence** for SMBs and mid-market companies.

## 🌟 The Mission

At its core, **Branca exists to empower businesses.**  

We’re not here to slap an SMB sticker on enterprise tools. We’re rethinking how decision-making tools should work for companies without armies of analysts or endless budgets.  

💡 **Our goal:** Give SMBs clarity to grow—without the fluff.

## 🛠️ What We’re Building

We’re deep in the trenches, working on:  

- **A Business Intelligence Platform**: Simple, intuitive, and seamless.  
- **Insights That Matter**: No endless dashboards—just actionable information.  
- **Scalable Tools**: Solutions that grow with businesses, not against them.  

Our stack includes:  
- **React.js** for the frontend  
- **Python** for the backend  

Every day brings new challenges (and plenty of learning opportunities).

## 💡 What I’ve Learned

Starting a company is no joke, but it’s been incredibly rewarding. Here are a few lessons so far:  

1. **The Devil’s in the Details**  
   UX, performance, backend logic—it *all* matters when building from scratch.  

2. **You Don’t Have to Know Everything**  
   Iteration and feedback are your best friends. (Huge thanks to our early testers!)  

3. **Focus Is Everything**  
   It’s easy to get distracted by shiny ideas. Solving real customer pain points is the key to success.

## 🔮 What’s Next?

We’re gearing up to release our **MVP** soon, and I couldn’t be more excited!  

📈 The goal? Get the product in the hands of businesses and use their feedback to make it even better.
