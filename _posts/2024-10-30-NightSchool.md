# 🌙 Night School: A CTF Adventure in Geocaching 🕵️‍♂️

## 🎭 Introduction

In the world of Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, challenges often take us to unusual places—sometimes even outside the virtual realm. Recently, I encountered a unique CTF task involving geocaching at George Mason University's Fairfax campus. Our goal? To locate a statue from an image left by a "famous geocacher" who had, as the story goes, vanished after dropping a cryptic clue. 🏛️🔍

## 🧩 The Challenge

### 📜 Prompt

> It's said that a famous geocacher has left a cache on our Fairfax campus. He took this picture before disappearing into the night. Could you help us find where this picture was taken? The flag is `pctf{NAME_OF_STATUE}`

### 🎯 Task: *nighttimestatue*

With only a dark, indistinct photo to go on, the challenge tested our resourcefulness in navigating the campus—without actually being there. The image's darkness ruled out Google Lens, so we had to get creative. 🖼️🔦

## 🕵️‍♀️ The Hunt

1. **Initial Search**: Started by searching "George Mason University statues" 🖥️
   - Expected to find a catalog of campus statues
   - Result: Overwhelmed by results about the George Mason statue 😓

2. **Persistence Pays Off**: After patient clicking and searching... 🔍
   - Discovered *discover-mason*, a valuable resource 💎
   - Found a gallery containing the exact statue from the image 🎉

## 🏆 The Solution

### 🔓 Solving: *nightschool-solve*

With the right statue identified, I unlocked the flag: `pctf{communitas}`.

This CTF experience was a reminder of the importance of patience and persistence, especially when the answers aren't immediately clear. Geocaching meets CTF—a fun, challenging blend of digital sleuthing and real-world problem-solving!
