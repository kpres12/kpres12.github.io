# Growing Up Past Friend Pricing: Lessons in Startup Growth

When you're starting out in any business—whether it's a side hustle, a freelance gig, or a full-fledged startup—there's a natural tendency to lean on your network for your first customers. Friends, family, and acquaintances are often the early adopters who give you your first "yes." They support you because they know you and want to help, not necessarily because they see the full value in what you're offering.

And let's be honest: you probably gave them a deal. **"Friend pricing"** is an unspoken agreement, an acknowledgment of your early-stage journey. But at some point, you have to grow up past friend pricing. Here's what I've learned along the way:

---

## 1. Friend Pricing Can Be a Crutch

When you're just starting out, it's easy to rely on friend pricing as a way to close sales quickly. But here's the harsh reality: **if you can't sell your product or service at full price, you might not have a sustainable business.** Friend pricing might make sense for your MVP, but it shouldn't define your future.

**💡 Lesson:** Use friend pricing sparingly. It’s a stepping stone, not the foundation of your business.

## 2. Discounted Pricing Skews Perception

People value what they pay for. If you're constantly offering discounts or "friend rates," it can unintentionally signal that your product or service isn't worth its full price. Worse, your discounted customers might share their experience with others, creating a ripple effect of undervaluation.

**💡 Lesson:** Charge what you're worth from the start. People respect confidence, and pricing is part of your brand story.

## 3. Your Time is Valuable

As your business grows, so do your responsibilities. Offering friend pricing often means you're leaving money on the table, which could be reinvested into scaling your operations, hiring talent, or improving your product.

**💡 Lesson:** Think of your time as a finite resource. Every "friend deal" is an opportunity cost.

## 4. Friends Aren’t Always Your Target Market

The people closest to you might not fully understand the value of your product, especially if it's tailored to a niche audience. That's okay! It’s a sign you’re moving toward a scalable business model.

**💡 Lesson:** **Find your tribe.** Your ideal customers are the ones who will pay full price because they see the value.

---

## 5. Growing Up Means Setting Boundaries

Moving past friend pricing doesn’t mean you don’t appreciate your early supporters. It means you’re establishing boundaries and respecting your own work. When you explain your pricing changes with transparency, true friends will understand—and cheer you on.

**💡 Lesson:** **Be honest.** “I’m grateful for your support in the early days. As I grow, I’ve realized I need to charge full price to make this sustainable.”

## Closing Thoughts

Growing up past friend pricing isn’t just about money—it’s about mindset. It’s the moment you stop seeing yourself as someone trying to make it and start seeing yourself as a professional. 

By charging what you're worth, you’re not just growing your business—you’re building the confidence and foundation needed for long-term success. And true friends? They’ll stick around.

**💼 Ready to grow up past friend pricing? The time is now.**
